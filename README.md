# graphical_calculator

As part of my learning on The Odin Project. I was tasked to created a graphical calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Let me tell you my thinking process while creating this project:
1. I started off by creating a flow chart on Apple Notes 
2. While creating the flow chart, I also noted all the possible problems that I could face when developing along with the possible solutions 
that I could think of.
3. While developing all the problems that I faced, I noted them down in the notes app and tried to find solutions through Google and various
Discord servers
5. Finally, I was able to build this application successfully.
